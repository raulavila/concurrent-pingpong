# Concurrent Ping Pong

Java application that will show in the standard output, and alternately the texts "ping" / "pong", along with a header and footer to begin and finish the game:

```
Game starting...!
ping
pong
ping
pong
//....
Game finished!
```

There will be two players (or actors), who will print the texts "ping" and "pong". The actor "ping" will play first.

This repository contains several implementations (separated by package, e.g. `version0`, `version1`...), as explained in the series of posts published in [The Practical Dev](https://dev.to).
